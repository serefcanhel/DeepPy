# DeepPy

  ==> This application is designed to simulate different deep learning algorithms in one application.
  ==> This application inspired from MATLAB/Deep Learning Toolbox.

# Deep Learning Algorithms
  
  ==> This algorithms exist seven different algorithms. These algorithms are  VGG 16, VGG19, Xception, Resnet 50, Resnet101, InceptionV3, and MobilenetV2.
  
  ==> The layers can not change by user. The image of the layers are also shown in application.
  
  ==> User can use any dataset to train.
  
# Scripts

  ==> main.py
	--> User needs to start main.py to start application.
  ==> widget.py
	--> The deep learning algorithms are exist in this script. Also, user can add other algorithms by using this script.
